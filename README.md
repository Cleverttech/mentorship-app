# 🎓 Mentorship App – Frontend

This is the **frontend** codebase for the **Mentorship Web App**, a platform that connects mentors with mentees through a credit-based booking system. The frontend is built with **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI (MUI)**, and handles all user-facing features.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **Material UI (MUI)**
- **React Router**
- **React Hook Form + Zod** (for form handling & validation)
- **Axios** (for API calls)
- **Vite / React Scripts** (depending on setup)
- **ESLint + Prettier** (code style & linting)
